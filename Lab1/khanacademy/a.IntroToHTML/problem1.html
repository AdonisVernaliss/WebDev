<h1>The Tyger</h1>
<p>Tyger! Tyger! burning bright<br>
    In the forests of the night,<br>
    What immortal hand or eye<br>
    Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br><br>

    In what distant deeps or skies<br>
    Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
    On what wings dare he aspire?<br>
    What the hand dare seize the fire?<br><br>

    And what shoulder, & what art.<br>
    Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br>
    And when thy heart began to beat,<br>
    What dread hand? & what dread feet?<br><br>

    What the hammer? what the chain?<br>
    In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
    What the anvil? what dread grasp?<br>
    Dare its deadly terrors clasp?<br><br>

    When the stars threw down their spears,<br>
    And watered heaven with their tears,<br>
    Did he smile his work to see?<br>
    Did he who made the Lamb make thee?<br><br>

    Tyger! Tyger! burning bright<br>
    In the forests of the night,<br>
    What immortal hand or eye<br>
    Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?</p>
